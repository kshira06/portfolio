# PORTFOLIO RESUME project

Hi there! I'm Kshira K, a diligent and inquisitive student studying Computer Science at Saveetha Engineering College. This site is part of my own personal growth processâ€”it's as much a collection of my work as it is an online resume intended to showcase my skills, projects, and aspirations in the technology space.

I made this project in order to put into practice everything that I've learned in web development, display some of the projects that I've done, and begin to create a professional web presence. It has pages such as About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact Info, all enclosed in a responsive, clean design.
